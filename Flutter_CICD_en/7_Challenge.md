# Challenge

@Eugenio Tesio

It is proven that the best way to learn is through challenges. At least in Spanish, it is well known the phrase "La necesidad es la madre de la invensi√≥n" which in English would be something like "Necessity is the mother of invention", we also say that "Challenges are the mother of learning" or "Teaching is learning", since it is very common in the software area to learn knowledge for oneself which is very different from learning it to teach it. That is why in this chapter we propose a challenge to the student to put his neurons and hands to work in code, which is what we love the most.

## Objective

Create a workflow to run integration test on the counter application by saving screenshots of the initial state of the application and after pressing the "+" button for at least 2 Android devices.

## Work assignments

- You must use arrays to run the test on different devices.
- The captured images should be stored in `screenshots/` and the aggregate directory in `.gitignore`.
- It must contain a `README.md` with the explanation of the challenge resolution.
- It must be in a public GitHub repository so that we can share the links in this course.
- Once finished, notify the Monkslab team for code review.
